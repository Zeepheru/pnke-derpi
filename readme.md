Technically this _does_ download images from [Derpibooru.org](https://derpibooru.org) if you're interested.

Mostly revolves around using the Derpibooru API to download 'configurable' batches of images, used as datasets for my personal computer vision projects.

No Documentation, but the code is somewhat configurable.
