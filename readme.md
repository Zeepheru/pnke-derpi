## Yes
Technically this _does_ download images from [Derpibooru.org](https://derpibooru.org) if you're interested.

Mostly revolves around using the Derpibooru API to download 'configurable' batches of images, used as datasets for my personal computer vision projects.

No Documentation, but the code is somewhat configurable.
| If I remember how to bloddy configure it, that is, which with my code is a monumental task.


# A MAJOR TODO

Now that I've written astronomical amounts of code for both derpi.py and derpibdatabase.py, for other purposes it may be wise to write those into a personal code library of sorts

Figure out how that's done.
